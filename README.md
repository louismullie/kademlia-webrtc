## Kademlia

**_Warning! There is nothing to see here yet._**

Javascript implementation of the Kamdelia Distributed Hash Table algorithm on top of WebRTC. This library is heavily based on the [Entangled](http://entangled.sourceforge.net/) Python library.

Kademlia is a distributed hash table with provable consistency and performance in a fault-prone environment. The [white paper](il.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) describes the algorithm in full detail.
